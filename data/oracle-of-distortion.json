In an empty space adjacent to each of those creatures, a perfect replica of that creature is conjured into existence with a burst of bright light. These replicants persist for 1 minute or until the oracle dies. Roll a d20 for each of these creatures and add them to the initiative order. These entities have 25 hit points, AC 13, and have a single attack: * ***Illusory Strike.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) force damage. These replicants are perfect copies and cannot be distinguished from the creature it is copying and will always attempt to stay adjacent to that creature. The replicant can mimic physical movements perfectly but cannot speak. If the real creature attempts to convince its allies they are the real version, have each creature within 60 feet that can see and hear both creatures make a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check, determining the true creature on a success. On a total result of 5 or lower on this check, the creature becomes convinced the replicant is the real version."
