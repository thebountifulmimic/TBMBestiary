In addition, a living creature hit by this attack must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer a gaping wound that causes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage at the end of each of the creature's turns until the wound is treated with magical healing or with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Medicine) check. If a creature who fails this saving throw is wearing armor or using a shield, the creature can choose to prevent the necrotic damage by permanently reducing the AC of its armor or shield by 1 instead."
