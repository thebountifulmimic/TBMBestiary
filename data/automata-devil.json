If the devil wins, the grappled creature is dragged into the devil's stomach maw, a mass of churning gears, razor teeth, and whirling blades. The creature takes 49 (4d20 + 7) slashing damage and is grappled, and the whip is free to attack again on the devil's next turn. The creature takes another 49 (4d20 +7) slashing damage automatically at the start of each of the automata devil's turns for as long as it remains grappled in the maw. Only one creature can be grappled in the punishing maw at a time. The automata devil can freely \"spit out\" a creature or corpse during its turn, to free up the maw for another victim."
