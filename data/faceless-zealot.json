The creature is blind until the effect fades. * Silence Eternal \u2013 The creature closes their mouth and is convinced it has been sealed shut permanently. The creature cannot speak until the effect fades. * Maddening Gibberish - All words the creature hears become twisted and garbled, shifting pitches and order in unpredictable ways. The creature cannot hear the voices of others until the effect fades."
