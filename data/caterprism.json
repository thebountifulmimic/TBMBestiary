In addition, when the caterprism attacks a creature with at least one head with its bite attack and rolls a natural 20 on the attack roll, it cuts off one of the creature\u2019s heads. The creature dies if it cannot survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this ability if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn\u2019t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for the head to be cut off with this attack. Such a creature instead takes an extra 27 (6d8) slashing damage from the hit."
