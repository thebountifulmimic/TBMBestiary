Targets slain by this attack are erased from the memories of every creature in the planes, all written or pictorial references to the target fade away, and its body is obliterated.the only exception is those who personally witnessed the death. Restoring such a slain creature requires a wish or divine intervention; no mortal remembers the creature's life or death."
