A transposer can have no more than 4 linked creatures at a time. While linked, the transposer knows the exact location of the target as long as it is on the same plane of existence. While the transposer remains linked to a target, any damage the transposer takes is halved, and each linked target takes an equal amount. If a transposer\u2019s linked target regain hit points, the amount received by the target is halved, and the transposer regains an equal amount of hit points. A <i>remove curse</i> or <i>dispel magic</i> cast on the linked target can end the link. If <i>dispel magic</i> is cast on the transposer, one random link is severed. Otherwise the link lasts until the targert dies or the transposer chooses to end the link."
