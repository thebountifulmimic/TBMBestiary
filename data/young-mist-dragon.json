This mist heavily obscures the area and remains for 1 minute, or until dispersed with a moderate or stronger wind (at least 10 miles per hour). 2. <i>Scalding Mist.</i> The dragon exhales a fiery blast of lingering mist in a 30-foot cone that spreads around corners. The mist lightly obscures the area and remains for 1 minute, or until dispersed with a moderate or stronger wind (at least 10 miles per hour). Each creature that enters the area or begins their turn there must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 49 (14d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn\u2019t grant resistance to this damage."

It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature\u2019s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can\u2019t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, it is immune to all nonmagical damage."
