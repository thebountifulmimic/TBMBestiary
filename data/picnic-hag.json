Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the hag can\u2019t bite another target. ***Swallow.** The hag makes a jaw attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the hag, and it takes 10 (4d4) acid damage at the start of each of the hag\u2019s turns. The hag can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the hag takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the hag must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the hag. If the hag dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone."

If the hag has swallowed a creature she can choose to eject the creature as part of her belch, depositing it prone within 10 feet of her."
