      "desc": "When a creature that can see the dark cadejo\u2019s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the dark cadejo, the dark cadejo can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the dark cadejo isn\u2019t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failure, the creature is paralyzed for as long as the dark cadejo maintains eye contact. A paralysed creature can repeat the saving at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This ability does not function for the dark cadejo while it is within 120 feet of a light cadejo. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can\u2019t see the dark cadejo until the start of its next turn when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dark cadejo in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."
