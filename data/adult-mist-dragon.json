This mist heavily obscures the area and remains for 1 minute, or until dispersed with a moderate or stronger wind (at least 10 miles per hour). 2. <i>Scalding Mist.</i> The dragon exhales a fiery blast of lingering mist in a 60-foot cone that spreads around corners. The mist lightly obscures the area and remains for 1 minute, or until dispersed with a moderate or stronger wind (at least 10 miles per hour). Each creature that enters the area or begins its turn there must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn\u2019t grant resistance to this damage."

In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can\u2019t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, it is immune to all nonmagical damage."
