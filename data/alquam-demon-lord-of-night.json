Even light created by artifacts is reduced to dim light with half its normal radius of illumination. This lasts until initiative count 20 on the following round. - Haunting, maddening music emanates from a point Alquam can see. Creatures within 50 feet of the origin that can hear the music must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail are charmed, incapacitated, and have their speed reduced to 0 until they take damage or until initiative count 20 on the following round. - Black tendrils writhe around up to three creatures Alquam can see within 100 feet. The creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20 on the following round."

If Alquam dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days."
