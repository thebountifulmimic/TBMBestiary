      "name": "Create Tornado (1/Day)",
      "desc": "The eagle gives a powerful flap of its wings that conjures up a 10-foot-radius, 100- foot-high tornado at a point within 120 feet. This tornado travels along a straight line, moving 30 feet a turn, for 1 minute. The area within the tornado is heavily obscured. The tornado sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren\u2019t secured to anything and that aren\u2019t worn or carried by anyone. A creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the tornado or that the tornado enters its space, including when the tornado first appears. A creature takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become restrained in the tornado until it disperses. When a creature starts its turn restrained within the tornado, the creature is pulled 10 feet higher inside of it, unless a creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless a creature has some means to stay aloft. A restrained creature can use an action to make a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity check. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the tornado and is hurled 3d6 x 10 feet away from it in a random direction."
