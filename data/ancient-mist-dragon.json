The mist lightly obscures the area and remains for 1 minute, or until dispersed with a moderate or stronger wind (at least 10 miles per hour). Each creature that enters the area or begins its turn there must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 77 (22d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can\u2019t pass through water.
