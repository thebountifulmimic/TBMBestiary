A valkyrie can likewise release any soul that has been bound by another valkyrie, or transfer a bound soul from one object to another. Once bound, the soul grants the item a +1 bonus for every 4 character levels of the soul (maximum of +3), and this replaces any other magic on the item. At the DM's discretion, part of this bonus can become an appropriate special quality (a fire giant's soul might create a flaming weapon, for example)."
