Instead, at the start of each of the tick\u2019s turns, the creature it is attached to takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and the tick gains the same amount of temporary hit points. While the tick is attached, a creature may use its action to make a DC 10 Athletics check, prying the tick loose on a success."
