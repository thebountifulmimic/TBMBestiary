The giant gains one of the following runic bonuses: * Rune of Destruction \u2013 The giant's greatclub attacks deal double damage to objects and structures. In addition, when the giant hits a creature with its greatclub, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet in a straight line and knocked prone. * Rune of Immortality \u2013 The giant's maximum hit points is increased by 20. In addition, if damage reduces the giant to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage was from a critical hit. On a success, the giant drops to 1 hit point instead. * Rune of Warding \u2013 The giant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects."
