The creature can aim both of its eye rays in any direction and they have a range of 150 feet. 1. ***Paralytic Ray.*** Using its left eye, the eye of the deep unleashes a powerful paralytic beam. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 2. ***Enfeeblement Ray.*** Using its right eye, the eye of the deep unleashes a powerful ray of enfeeblement. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or deal half damage with all attacks that use Strength for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 3. ***Major Image.*** The eye of the deep concentrates its eye rays together to project a major image illusion. The illusion is generated at any point within range and in the eye of the deep\u2019s line of sight. Seeing through the illusion requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check."
