A creature that interacts with the huecuva must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check to realize the appearance of the huecuva is an illusion. Creatures with the Keen Smell trait automatically pass the check versus the illusion as the scent of the huecuva remains that of the grave."

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the poisoned target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target\u2019s hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured."
