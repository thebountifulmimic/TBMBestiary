      "desc": "Whenever the shaper performs an unarmed strike, it can imbue the attack with elemental magics, granting additional properties depending on the element chosen: * Fire \u2013 The strike deals an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage and has its range increased by 10 feet as a whip of flame extends from the shaper's hands. * Ice \u2013 The strike inflicts chill into the heart of the target, reducing its move speed by 10 feet and preventing it from taking the disengage action until the end of your next turn. * Lightning \u2013 The strike surges lightning through the target's body. If that creature attempts to cast a spell requiring somatic components on its next turn, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be unable to perform the required motions, causing the spell to fail."
