The target must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone in the slick oil, which covers an area 5 feet square. A creature that enters the oily area or ends its turn there must also make the Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling prone. A creature needs to make only one saving throw per 5-foot-square per turn, even if it enters and ends its turn in the area. The slippery effect lasts for 3 rounds."

      "desc": "A bagiennik can automatically stabilize a dying creature by smearing some of its oily secretion on the dying creature's flesh. A similar application on an already-stable creature or one with 1 or more hit points acts as a potion of healing, restoring 2d4 + 2 hit points. Alternatively, the bagiennik's secretion can have the effect of a <i>lesser restoration</i> spell. However, any creature receiving a bagiennik's Healing Oil must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be slowed for 1 minute."
