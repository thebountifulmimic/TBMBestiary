This is a bonus action that provokes an attack of opportunity and lasts only one round. While occupying two spaces simultaneously, each representation of the quantum can perform one action normally. Using this ability, the same quantum could attack two different opponents, or attack one opponent while opening a door to escape, and so on. At the end of the round, both instances of the quantum return to the space it originally occupied before activating this ability."
