Whenever the savageclaw moves, this poison follows along and fills every space the savageclaw touched during its movement. This poison dissipates after 1 round. Any creature that moves through one of these poison clouds must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) poison damage. A creature that holds their breath while moving through one of these spaces has advantage on the saving throw."
