Creatures in this area must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw and are pushed 60 feet directly away from the dragon. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half damage and is not pushed. A creature who is pushed and strikes a solid surface takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet traveled. Nonmagical flames are completely extinguished, and magical flames created by a spell of 4th level or lower are immediately dispelled."

In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can\u2019t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, it is immune to all nonmagical damage, and still benefits from its Windborn feature."
