For every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the DC 14 Constitution saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The germinating seed is destroyed by the immune system on a success. The target dies if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target\u2019s hit point maximum lasts until the blood bush seed is removed."
