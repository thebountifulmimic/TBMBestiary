If the hamster takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the hamster must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of it. If the hamster dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone."
