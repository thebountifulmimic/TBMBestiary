      "desc": "Using his unique knowledge of plants and herbal mixtures, an oakman can concoct unusual cakes from tree moss. A typical oakman has 3 (1d6) moss cakes of random type on his person. These moss cakes have a variety of effects and must be eaten by the target creature to take effect. 1. ***Coloration.*** This moss cake is quite harmless when eaten and does nothing more than cause the target\u2019s skin to become spotted. The spots can be of just about any color, though most tend to be brown, red, or blue. The spots last for 1 hour before fading. 2. ***Healing.*** This moss cake heals the target of 22 (5d8) damage. 3. ***Lethargy.*** The target falls into a state of apathy and becomes sluggish if it fails a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers from three levels of exhaustion, which can be removed normally. 4. ***Pain.*** Eating this moss cake wracks the target with pain for 1 hour if it fails a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. During this time, the target moves at half speed, and has disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 hour. 5. ***Poison.*** Eating this moss cake poisons the target. The target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 7 (2d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned, the target must repeat the saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns. On a failed saving throw, the target spends its action retching and vomiting. 6. ***Sleep.*** This moss cake puts the target to sleep for 1 hour if it fails a DC 12 Constitution saving throw."
