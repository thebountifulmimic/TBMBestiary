The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, and it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the ventrunculus. At the start of each of the ventrunculus's turns, each swallowed creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or fall unconcious. While unconscious, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn\u2019t age. Divination magic can\u2019t locate or perceive the target. While the ventrunculus isn't incapacitated, it can regurgitate swallowed creatures at any time (no action required) into spaces within 5 feet of it. The creatures exit prone. If the ventrunculus dies, it likewise regurgitates swallowed creatures. Unconscious creatures regain consciousness when regurgitated."
