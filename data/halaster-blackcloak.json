      "desc": "Halaster wears a *robe of eyes* that lets him see in all directions, gives him darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, grants advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and allows him to see invisible creatures and objects, as well as into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet. Halaster wields a *blast scepter* (a very rare magic item that requires attunement). It can be used as an arcane focus. Whoever is attuned to the *blast scepter* gains resistance to fire and lightning damage and can, as an action, use it to cast *thunderwave* as a 4th-level spell (save DC 16) without expending a spell slot. Halaster also wears a *horned ring* (a very rare magic item that requires attunement), which allows an attuned wearer to ignore Undermountain\u2019s magical restrictions (see \u201cAlterations to Magic\u201d)."
