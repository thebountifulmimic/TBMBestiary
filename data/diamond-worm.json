A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the worm\u2019s turns. If the worm takes at least 10 damage in a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone."
