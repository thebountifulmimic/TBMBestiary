On a failed save, one such item worn or carried by the creature (the target's choice) magically deteriorates, taking a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers, and the zorbo gains a +l bonus to AC until the start of its next turn. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield or magic item that drops to a 0 AC increase is destroyed."
