      "desc": "The corpse candle creates a twisting, dancing pattern of ever-shifting colored lights in a 10-foot cube at a point it can see within 60 feet of itself. The pattern appears for a minute then vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for 1 minute. While charmed, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0. When a charmed creature takes damage it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. A creature that starts its turn within the 10-foot cube of lights must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or the target\u2019s Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Constitution to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest."
