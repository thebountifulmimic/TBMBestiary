      "desc": "When it takes fire damage, or as an action on its turn, the automaton's fuse lights. At the start of each of the automaton's turns, roll a d4. On a result of 1, the automaton explodes in a 15- foot radius fireball at the start of its next turn, forcing each creature in the area to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) fire damage plus 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If the automaton is killed, the fuse remains lit, potentially setting off the explosion after its death. If another creature hits the automaton with an unarmed strike attack, the creature can choose to snuff out the fuse instead of dealing damage."
