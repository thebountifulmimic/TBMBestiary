      "desc": "When a creature that can see the strix's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the strix, the strix can force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw if the strix isn\u2019t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the creature fails the saving throw, it becomes frightened. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, ending the effect on a success and becoming immune to the strix's horrifying visage for 24 hours. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the strix until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If a creature looks at the strix in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."
