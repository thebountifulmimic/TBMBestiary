An affected creature is teleported in a random direction and a random distance (1d10 x 100 feet) away from the crypt thing. Roll randomly for each creature that fails its saving throw. If the affected creature would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or another creature, the affected creature takes 14 (4d6) force damage and is not teleported."
