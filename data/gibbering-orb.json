On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can\u2019t make such an attack."

Stolen spells and innate magic abilities are lost after 24 hours."
