      "desc": "The eel makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the eel, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the eel\u2019s turns. The eel can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the eel takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from the creature inside of it, the eel must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the eel. If the eel dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone."
