The whirlwind is 10 feet wide and up to 50 feet tall. A creature in the area of the whirlwind when it's created, or who enters the area for the first time on a turn, must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage fromthe buffeting wind. A restrained creature can escape from the whirlwind by using its action to repeat the saving throw; on a success, it moves 5 feet outside the area of the whirlwind. The whirlwind lasts until Koschei uses this action again or dies - Tortured spirits appear and attack up to three creatures Koschei can see within the lair. One attack is made against each targeted creature; each attack has +8 to hit and does 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. - Koschei disrupts the flow of magic in his lair. Until initiative count 20 on the following round, any creature other than a fiend who targets Koschei with a spell must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature still casts the spell, but it must target a creature other than Koschei."

They behave aggressively, but only attack if cornered. Foraging for food by hunting is difficult and only yields half the normal amount of food. - Wind and snowstorms are common within 5 miles of the lair. - Koschei is aware of any spell cast within 5 miles of his lair. He knows the source of the magic (innate, the caster's class, or a magic item) and knows the direction to the caster. If Koschei dies, conditions in the area surrounding his lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days."
