It drops whatever weapon it was carrying, cannot hold a weapon in that hand, and cannot cast spells that require somatic components. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Casting <i>mending</i> on the affected hand also ends the effect. If the target succeeds on a saving throw, the creature becomes immune to Baron Malgas\u2019s Melt Flesh for the next 24 hours."
