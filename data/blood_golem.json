On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the blood golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points. The golem\u2019s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again."

Creatures inside the blood golem can\u2019t be seen and have total cover. A creature within 5 feet of the blood golem can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

The reduction in the target\u2019s hit point maximum lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0."

On a failed save, the blood golem enters the creature\u2019s space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can\u2019t breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the blood golem\u2019s turns. When the blood golem moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the blood golem."
