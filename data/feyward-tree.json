A magical attack that deals lightning damage breaks any slow effect on the feyward tree and heals 1 hit point for each 3 damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the tree to exceed its full normal hp, it gains any excess as temporary hp. The tree gets no saving throw against lightning effects."
