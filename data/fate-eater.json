The target must roll 1d6 on the chart below for each critical hit that isn't negated by a successful DC 15 Charisma saving throw: 1- Seeing the Alternates: Suffers the effects of the confusion spell for 1d4 rounds 2- Untied from the Loom: Character's speed is randomized for four rounds. Roll 3d20 at the start of each of the character's turns to determine his or her speed in feet that turn 3- Shifting Memories: Permanently loses 2 from a random skill and gains 2 in a random untrained skill 4- Not So Fast: Loses the use of one class ability, chosen at random 5- Lost Potential: Loses 1 point from one randomly chosen ability score 6- Took the Lesser Path: The character's current hit point total becomes his or her hit point maximum Effects 3-6 are permanent until the character makes a successful Charisma saving throw. The saving throw is repeated after every long rest, but the DC increases by 1 after every long rest, as the character becomes more entrenched in this new destiny. Otherwise, these new fates can be undone by nothing short of a wish spell or comparable magic."
