For the next 2d6 rounds, the behtus gain a +4 bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores and quadruple their base speed (including their climb speed). Behtus also take a -4 penalty to their Intelligence and Wisdom scores for the duration of the infusion. A non-behtu character who ingests a behtu infusion becomes poisoned and takes 10 (3d6) poison damage; a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw against poison reduces damage to half and negates the poisoned condition."
