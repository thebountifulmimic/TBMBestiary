In this dream, the oozasis places a compulsion to carry out some activity as a torrent of images and sensations. When the creature awakens, it is affected by a geas spell (save DC 16, cast as a 7th-level spell) in addition to the effects of dream."

The creature takes no damage if the oozasis chooses not to inflict any. When the oozasis moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can escape by using an action and making a successful DC 16 Strength check. On a success, the creature enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the oozasis."

All creatures in the area are affected by either the calm emotions spell or the confusion spell (save DC 16). The oozasis chooses which effect to use, and it must be the same for all creatures."
