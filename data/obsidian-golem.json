The golem is programmed to use this only for max efficiency so it will wait until it holds 2 targets to use it. Each grappled creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much as a successful one. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a puddle of molten flesh."
