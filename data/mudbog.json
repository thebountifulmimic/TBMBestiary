Any wood or other organic material that touches the mudbog is pitted. Wooden weapons suffer a cumulative \u20131 penalty to damage rolls made with it unless it is magical. When this penalty reaches \u20135, the weapon is destroyed."

      "desc": "The mudbog moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Medium or smaller creatures\u2019 spaces. Whenever the mudbog enters a creature\u2019s space, the creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the mudbog. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is engulfed and the mudbog enters the creature\u2019s space. The creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage. The engulfed creature can\u2019t breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the ooze\u2019s turns. When the mudbog moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 13 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ooze."
