      "desc": "When a creature dies within 15 feet of a gallows tree, The Gallow\u2019s Tree uses a sharpened tendril to slice open the creature\u2019s abdomen, thereby spilling the corpse\u2019s innards on the ground. The organs and fluids are then absorbed by the tree\u2019s roots. Corpses of a size other than Medium or Large are simply left to rot. Medium or Large corpses are filled with a greenish pollen fired from one of the tree\u2019s branches. The abdominal wound heals over the next 1d4 days, at which time the slain creature rises as a gallows tree zombie connected by a tether-vine to the gallows tree that created it. Gallows tree zombies possess none of their former abilities."
