The dust devil lasts as long as the al-Aeshma maintains concentration (as if a spell). Any creature but the al-Aeshma that enters the dust devil must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it; any number of creatures may be restrained this way. At the start of a restrained creature's turn, it takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The al-Aeshma can move the dust devil up to 60 feet as an action; restrained creatures move with it. The dust devil ends if the al-Aeshma loses sight of it. A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the dust devil, including itself, by making a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, it moves to the nearest space outside the dust devil."
