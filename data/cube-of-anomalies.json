      "desc": "The anomaly shifts itself around and unleashes two effects at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to two targets it can see within 120 feet of it. 1. ***Red.*** <i>Locational Displacement.</i> The target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be teleported 50 feet into the air and luanched downward. They smash into the ground at the end of their next turn, taking 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage as they do so. 2. ***Blue.*** <i>Aquatic Prison.</i> The target is surrounded by 10 foot cube of water and is considered grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. At the start of each of the grappled creature\u2019s turns, it takes 14 (2d8 + 5) cold damage as freezing cold water churns around them. Another creature within 5 feet of the prison can attempt to pull the trapped creature free by taking an action to make a DC 15 Athletics check. On a success, they free the target from the prison. On a natural 1, they are pulled into the prison as well. 3. ***Yellow.*** <i>Blinding Beam.</i> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) radiant damage and being blinded until the end of their next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and not blinded on a success. 4. ***Purple.*** <i>Mental Onslaught.</i> The targeted creature must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) psychic damage and rolling their first attack on their next turn with disadvantage on a failed save, or half as much damage and not given disadvantage on a successful one. 5. ***Green.*** <i>Ability Reassessment.</i> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target\u2019s highest and lowest ability scores are swapped. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 6. ***Orange.*** <i>Barbed Bindings.</i> Tendrils of barbed wire burst into existence and attempt to surround the targeted creature. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) piercing damage and become restrained. At the start of the restrained creature\u2019s turns it takes an additional 14 (4d6) damage. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
