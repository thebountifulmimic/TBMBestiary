The cursed target can\u2019t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target\u2019s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to pluff mud. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic."

A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare for all mummies (but no mummy lords) for the next 24 hours."

If the creature has not broken the mummy\u2019s grapple by the start of the mummy\u2019s next turn, the mummy uses its next action to press its lips against the creature\u2019s and regurgitates seawater into the creature\u2019s lungs. The creature immediately begins suffocating (see the fifth edition SRD for more information on suffocation). While suffocating, the creature can only use its actions to try and cough the seawater up, requiring a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw to do so."
