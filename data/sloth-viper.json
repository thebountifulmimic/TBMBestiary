On a failed saving throw, the target takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and the target is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and isn\u2019t poisoned. While the target is poisoned, its speed is halved, it can\u2019t use reactions, and it can take only one action or one bonus action on each of its turns, and regardless of abilities or magic items, it can\u2019t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn\u2019t take effect until the creature\u2019s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can\u2019t, the spell is wasted."
