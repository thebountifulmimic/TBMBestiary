For example, if asked, \"Please make those children new shoes,\" they will happily slay the children and use their skins to make new shoes. They don't do this on purpose. They just get absolutely everything horribly, horribly wrong whenever it is at all possible to do so. Even when they do properly understand a request, they will find a horrible way to execute it. For example, if asked, \"Please bring me a glass of water,\" they might steal a poor family\u2019s only nice glass or open a gateway to the elemental plane of water, flooding the town, just to fill the glass. Everything they can do wrong, they will."
