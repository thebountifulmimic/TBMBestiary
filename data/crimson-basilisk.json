      "desc": "If a target starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the target to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn\u2019t incapacitated. On a failed save, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage as blood weeps from the victim\u2019s eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the target takes an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage and will continue to take recurring damage at the end of each of its turns (without further chance to save) unless the basilisk is incapacitated or the effect is ended by the greater restoration spell or other magic. A creature that isn\u2019t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can\u2019t see the creature until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."
