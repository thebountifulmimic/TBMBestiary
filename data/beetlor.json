      "desc": "When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the beetlor and is able to see the beetlor\u2019s multifaceted eyes, the beetlor can force the creature to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw if the beetlor isn\u2019t incapacitated. On a failure, the creature can\u2019t take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn: * 1-4: The creature does nothing. * 5-6: The creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. * 7-8: The creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can\u2019t make such an attack. A creature that isn\u2019t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can\u2019t see the beetlor until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the beetlor in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."
