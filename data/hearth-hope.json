A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition or confusion on itself on a success.

The hope now controls the body but doesn\u2019t deprive the target of awareness. The hope can\u2019t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target\u2019s statistics, but doesn\u2019t gain access to the target\u2019s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the hope ends it as a bonus action, or the hope is turned or forced out by an effect like the <i>dispel evil and good</i> spell. When the possession ends, the hope reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this hope\u2019s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."
