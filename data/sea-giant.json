The water pressure within the space magically increases, and creatures within the area treat it as difficult terrain. In addition, any creature who enters or begins its turn within the area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area remains affected by this magic for 1 minute, until the sea giant dismisses it as an action, or the sea giant dies."
