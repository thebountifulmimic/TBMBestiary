      "desc": "One creature other than a construct or undead that is in the devouring mist\u2019s space must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 28 (8d6) necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. In addition, the mist regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction to the target\u2019s hit point maximum lasts until the target finishes a long rest. It dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under the mist\u2019s control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The mist can have no more than twelve zombies under its control at one time."
