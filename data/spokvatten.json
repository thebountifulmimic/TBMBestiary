      "desc": "The sp\u00f6kvatten can use its action to magically polymorph into a Large cloud of mist, into a beast or humanoid of challenge rating 2 or lower, or back into its true form (that of a Medium fey). Anything it is carrying or wearing transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies. While in beast or humanoid form, the sp\u00f6kvatten retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. In mist form, the sp\u00f6kvatten can only use its icy fog ability, and it is unable to speak or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature\u2019s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can\u2019t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage."
