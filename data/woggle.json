      "desc": "The woggle babbles in its bizarre woggle-speak while it can see any creature and isn\u2019t incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the woggle and can hear it must succeed on a DC 11 Intelligence saving throw or be cursed with woggle-speak. The cursed target loses all of its languages and can only speak and write the word \"woggle.\" While cursed, casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible. Woggle-speak is gibberish and can\u2019t be understood with a comprehend languages spell or similar magic, nor understood by others with the same curse. Telepathy, mind-reading, and other spells used for non-verbal communication similarly don\u2019t work as the cursed creature can only create images of the word \u201cwoggle\u201d or a physical woggle in its mind. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic. Creatures immune to being charmed automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours."
