When submerged in a natural pool of standing water, it can transport itself as a bonus action to a similar body of water within 5,000 feet. Rapidly flowing water doesn't serve for this ability, but the zmey can leap to or from a river or stream where the water is calm and slow-moving."

If the zmey takes 40 or more damage in a single turn (and the damage isn't poison or psychic), one of its heads is severed. If all three of its heads are severed, the zmey dies."

If cones overlap, their damage adds together but each target makes only one saving throw. A zmey can choose whether this attack harms plants or plant creatures."
