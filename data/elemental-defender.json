They start off with resistance to either cold, fire, or lightning damage and deal additional damage of the same type. Whenever the defender is damaged by another of these elements, it may use its reaction to shift its elemental properties, changing its resistance and extra damage to the new type instead as well as gaining 10 temporary hit points. The crystal in its chest changes color to reflect this shift."

On a failure, the crystal in its chest cannot handle the extra stress and explodes, shutting down the defender."
