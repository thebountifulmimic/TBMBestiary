If the immediate area is searched, it is found to be lightly dusted in a fine green powder of emerald dust, which can be collected and used to create both potent poisons and poison-based magics."

The green bulette will maintain its gaseous form and use it to attack, attempting to poison and choke its adversaries. It will only revert to its solid state again once it is safe and free from attack."
