The orc can choose whether its equipment falls to the ground, melds with its new form, or is worn by the new form. The orc reverts to its true form when its dire wolf form is reduced to 0 hit points. If this damage would cause its dire wolf form to drop below 0 hit points, the excess damage is done to its true form. The orc also reverts to its true form if it dies or falls unconscious. The orc can revert to its true form as a bonus action on its turn. When it reverts in this way, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed."
