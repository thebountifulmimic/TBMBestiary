The berstuc can hold one absorbed creature at a time. If the berstuc takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the berstuc must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or expel the absorbed creature, which falls prone within 5 feet of the berstuc. If the berstuc dies, an absorbed creature is no longer restrained and can escape from the corpse by using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone."
