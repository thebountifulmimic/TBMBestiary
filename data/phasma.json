To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn\u2019t take an action this turn. * ***2-6.*** The creature doesn\u2019t move or take actions this turn. * ***7-8.*** The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. * ***9-10.*** The creature can act and move normally. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success."
