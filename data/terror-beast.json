On a result of 11 or higher, the attack hits part of its illusory appearance and does no damage. Each time the terror beast is successfully hit, it changes form to a new horror. Creatures with blindsight or truesight can see the terror beast\u2019s true form and are not affected by this feature. Whenever the terror beast dies, it reverts to its actual form as a small, seemingly non-threatening creature."

If they fail the save by 10 or more, they become convinced their eyes are torn out. Even though the effects aren\u2019t real, the victim is convinced it is reality and suffer from the same detriments as if they actually lost that body part. This deception ends when the terror beast dies."

Each creature within 30 feet of the terror beast must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) psychic damage and becoming paralyzed with fear until the end of their next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and not paralyzed on a successful one. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points from this attack, the terror beast regains 20 hit points."

      "desc": "The terror beast infests the mind of a creature within 90 feet with nightmare and forces it to live out its own death over and over, each death more gruesome than the last. Have that player make death saving throws until they reach 3 successes, 3 failures, or rolls a natural 20. If they reached 3 failures, the creature takes 55 (10d10) psychic damage and has disadvantage on all attacks, saving throws, and ability checks for the next 1d4 turns. On 3 successes, the creature takes half as much psychic damage and does not have disadvantage. If the player rolls a natural 20 on one of their saves, the effect ends immediately with no damage dealt as their mind conquers this attack."
