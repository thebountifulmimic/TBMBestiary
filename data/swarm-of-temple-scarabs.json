Hit: 10 (4d4) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or 1d4 scarabs burrows under the skin of the target. A creature may use one of its attack actions to attempt to cut out a scarab. That creature makes a DC 10 sleight of hand check, cutting it out of the victim on a success and dealing 3 damage to the swarm. Success or fail, the creature in which the scarab is burrowed takes 1 point of piercing damage from this maneuver. If a scarab is burrowed, at the end of each of its turns it moves closer to the creature\u2019s brain, dealing an additional 1 piercing damage. If the scarab is not removed after 3 turns of being burrowed, it latches on to the brain of the creature and takes control of its body until removed. A creature that has a scarab removed from its brain falls unconscious for 1d4 days."
