All other creatures within 60 feet of the jester must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail fall prone in a fit of deadly laughter. The laughter lasts 1d4 rounds, during which time the victim is incapacitated and unable to stand up from prone. At the end of its turn each round, an incapacitated victim must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points. The laughter can be ended early by rendering the victim unconscious or with greater restoration or comparable magic."
