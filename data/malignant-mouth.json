The target can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. 3. ***Sleep.*** If the target has less than 5d8 hit points, it falls asleep as per the sleep spell. 4. ***Cure Wounds.*** The target is healed for 1d8+2 hit points. 5. ***Vomit.*** The target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be immobilized for 2d4 rounds. On a successful saving throw, the target moves at half speed for 1d4 rounds. 6. ***Tongue Lash.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 10/20 ft., one creature. Hit: the target is pulled next to the malignant mouth, which can then make a bite attack against it with advantage."
