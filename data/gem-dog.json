A creature that isn\u2019t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can\u2019t see the gem dog until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the gem dog in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."
