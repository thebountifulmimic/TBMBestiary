Blood is drained so slowly that the victim doesn't notice the damage unless he or she breaks contact with the treacle (sets it down or hands it to someone else, for example). When contact is broken, the victim notices blood on his or her skin or clothes with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check."
