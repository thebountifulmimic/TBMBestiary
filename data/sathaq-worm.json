A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of the sathaq worm's turns. The sathaq worm can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the sathaq worm takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the sathaq worm must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the sathaq worm. If the sathaq worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone."
