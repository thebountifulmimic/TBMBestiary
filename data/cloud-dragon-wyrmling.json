Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) cold damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. * <i>Wind Breath.</i> The dragon exhales gale-force winds in a 20-foot line that is 10-feet wide. Creatures in this area must make a DC 11 Strength saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw and are pushed 20 feet directly away from the dragon. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half damage and is not pushed. A creature who is pushed and strikes a solid surface takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet traveled. Nonmagical flames are completely extinguished, and magical flames created by a spell of 2nd level or lower are immediately dispelled."
