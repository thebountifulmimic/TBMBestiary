An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; a success ends the effect on itself, but a failure means it must roll again on the table below at the start of its next turn. 1 - Act normally 2-4 - Do nothing but babble incoherently 5-6 - Do 1d8 damage + Str modifier to self with item in hand 7-8 - Attack nearest target; select randomly if more than one"

The effect lasts for 10 minutes and moves with the theullai."
