On a successful saving throw, the amber ooze is expelled from the host\u2019s body into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the host. On a failed saving throw, the amber ooze infuses itself into the host\u2019s body. The amber ooze has total cover from effects outside the host\u2019s body, and is blind and deafened. While the amber ooze is infused, the host creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns. On a failed saving throw, the host takes 7 (2d6) acid damage, or half as much damage on a successful saving throw. If this damage drops to host to 0 hit points, its insides are liquefied and another amber ooze is created. An amber ooze can be forcibly removed with magic such as <i>lesser restoration</i>."
