      "name": "Petrifying Gaze",
      "desc": "When a creature that can see Phoba\u2019s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of her, she can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if she isn\u2019t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can\u2019t see Phoba until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Phoba in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If Phoba sees herself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of her and in an area of bright light, she is, due to her curse, affected by her own gaze."
