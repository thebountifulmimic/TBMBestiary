The target creature must be within 25 feet of the emerald eye when attraction is triggered, but the creature is then free to move beyond this range while remaining under the effect. Nothing seems out of the ordinary to the creature, but it does not knowingly put itself or its allies in harm's way to reach the object. The creature may attempt another DC 13 Charisma saving throw at the start of each of its turns; a success ends the effect."
