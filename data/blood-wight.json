If the wight takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the wight must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all engulfed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 5 feet of the wight. If the wight dies, all engulfed creatures explode out from the corpse, falling prone 15 feet away."

The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under the wight\u2019s control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve zombies under its control at one time."
