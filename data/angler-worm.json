While grappled this way, the creature is restrained by the angler worm (but not by its snare lines), it can't breathe, and it takes 22 (5d8) acid damage at the start of each of the angler worm's turns. A creature that escapes from the angler worm's coils may need to make an immediate DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being restrained again, if it escapes into a space occupied by more snare lines."

All other creatures that can see the light at the start of their turn must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of their next turn. A creature charmed this way must Dash toward the light by the most direct route, automatically fails saving throws against being restrained by snare lines, and treats the angler worm as invisible."
