The devil may be of any random type (GM\u2019s discretion) save that of a royal rank. The devil will be grateful to whoever is responsible for ending its centuries-long confinement, and will offer the responsible parties one favor in payment before returning to the infernal realms of its home plane. Wise recipients of this offer should bear in mind that the usual caveats of treating with devils remain in full force when striking any bargains."

Coming into physical contact with a black bulette results in the creature being imparted with a horrid stench that causes it to have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks for 12 hours. The stench can be removed sooner with plenty of soap, water, and two full hours of scrubbing."
