All creatures other than undead or constructs within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) acid damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The cloud disperses in 1 minute, or can be dispersed by a moderate or greater wind."
