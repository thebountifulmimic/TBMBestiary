If the saving throw fails, the face is torn off; the target takes 38 (8d6 + 10) slashing damage and is stunned until the start of the hag's next turn. If the save succeeds, the target takes half damage and isn't stunned. Heal, regeneration, or comparable magic restores the stolen features; other curative magic forms a mass of scar tissue. The peeled-off face is a tiny, animated object (per the spell-20 HP, AC 18, no attack, Str 4, Dex 18) under the hag's control. It retains the former owner's memories and personality. Blood hags keep such faces as trophies, but they can also wear someone's face to gain advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to imitate the face's former owner."
