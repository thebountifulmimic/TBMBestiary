      "desc": "On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Nicnevin takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Nicnevin can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: - Nicnevin causes a searing flare of moonlight to burst from a point she can see within 100 feet. All creatures Nicnevin chooses within 30 feet of that point take 13 (3d8) radiant damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Creatures not in their natural form have disadvantage on the saving throw, and if they fail, they revert to their natural form immediately (this does not affect any shape-changing effect created by Nicnevin). - A wall of softly glowing crystal springs up from a solid surface in the lair. The wall is 60 feet long, 10 feet high, 5 feet thick, blocks line of sight, and sheds dim light out to 10 feet. Creatures within the wall's area when it appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) radiant damage. The creature is pushed out of the wall's space to whichever side it chooses. Each 5-foot section of the wall has AC 15, 10 hit points, resistance to fire, slashing, and piercing damage, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder. The wall lasts until Nicnevin uses this action again or dies. - Until initiative count 20 on the following round, any creatures other than fey who attempt to cast a spell must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or the spell fails and the spell slot is expended. A creature becomes aware of this effect the moment it begins casting a spell, and it can choose to take a different action instead."

She may visit the supplicant and hear a request, especially if the request is repeated on multiple nights. For 24 hours after the invocation, Nicenvin has a connection to the area that allows her to target it with teleportation circle. - Despite the weather, the moon is always visible for most of the night within 10 miles of the lair. Cloud cover has many breaks, or the moon's light sharply penetrates the clouds. - Silvery fog is common within 10 miles of the lair, and strange whispers are heard within the mist. If Nicnevin dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days."
