If the saving throw fails, the target takes 11 (2d10) poison damage immediately and becomes poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the creature must repeat the saving throw and reduce its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0."
