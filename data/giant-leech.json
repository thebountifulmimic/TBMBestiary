Instead, at the start of the leech\u2019s turns, the target loses 5 (1d8 + 1) hit points due to blood loss. The leech can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 25 hit points of blood from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check to rip the leech off and make it detach."
