Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem. A greater restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad. Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad."
