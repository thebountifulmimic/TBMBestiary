      "desc": "When the aberrant fungi drops to 0 hit points, it explodes. Each creature within 20 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) psychic damage and become infected with a disease. If a humanoid drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage, it dies. After 24 hours, 1d4 Tiny aberrant fungi sprout from the body, growing to full size in 7 days. The spores are destroyed if the creature is raised from the dead, or if the corpse is targeted by a remove curse or similar magic, before the aberrant fungi sprout. Spores invade the affected creature\u2019s mind, afflicting the creature with short term madness for 1d10 minutes. After that time elapses, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted with long term madness for 1d10 x 10 hours. The creature must then succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be afflicted with indefinite madness. The madness can be cured by a lesser restoration or similar magic."
