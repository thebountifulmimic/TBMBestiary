The herald can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the herald takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the herald must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or forcefully disgorge the creature, which falls prone in a space within 20 feet of the herald. If the herald dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone."

On a failed save, the creature is also deafened for 1 minute. A deafened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
