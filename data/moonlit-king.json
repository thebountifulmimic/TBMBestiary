The beams each illuminate a 10-foot radius with dim light. These moon beams last until the Moonlit King uses this action again, or until he dies. - The Moonlit King chooses a point he can see within 100 feet. Disembodied whispers speaking of despair and failure fill a 30-foot radius from that point. All creatures other than fiends in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until initiative count 20 on the following round. - The Moonlit King magically summons four shadow demons. The demons appear in unoccupied spaces the Moonlit King can see within 60 feet. The demons act immediately and remain until initiative count 20 on the following round."
