At the start of that creature\u2019s turn, it is affected by this orb based on how many turns the capture soul effect has been active. If a creature under the effects of this ability is reduced to 0 hit points for any reason, their soul is immediately captured. The only way to end this effect is to destroy the orb or travel to another plane. * 1st Turn - The creature must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. * 2nd Turn - The creature must make succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed until the soul orb is destroyed. * 3rd Turn - The creature\u2019s soul is ripped from its body and trapped within the soul orb. They are unconscious, but stable, until the soul orb is destroyed. If the soul harvester consumes their soul to cast a spell or enhance an ability, the creature is instantly killed."
