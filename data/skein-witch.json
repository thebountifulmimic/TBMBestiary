If the character died in the manner predicted, they fulfill their destiny and are immediately resurrected by the gods as a reward. If they died at or within one level of the prediction, they return to life with some useful insight into the destiny of someone important."

This effect is cumulative; each inexorable threads hit adds one unsuccessful death saving throw. If a character who's been hit three or more times by inexorable threads is reduced to 0 hit points, he or she dies immediately. This effect lasts until the character completes a long rest."

Any damage or condition the target suffers is inflicted on the individual to which they are bound instead, and vice versa. A creature can be bound to only one other creature at a time. This effect lasts until either of the affected creatures gains a level, or until a heal or heroes' feast lifts this binding."

In addition, if more than one target that failed its saving throw is affected by a condition, those conditions are randomly redistributed among the targets with failed saving throws."
