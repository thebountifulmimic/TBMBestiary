In addition, the wood goblin\u2019s innate cure wounds spells can be imitated herbally without limitation as long as the wood goblin has access to wild plants. However, the herbal versions require 15 minutes to prepare and must be fresh, and thus are not usable in combat."

It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn and it takes 7 (2d6) poison damage. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can\u2019t take reactions."
