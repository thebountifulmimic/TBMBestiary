      "desc": "The squirrel unleashes a burst of pollen from the flowers that cover its body. Each non-floral creature within 10 feet of the squirrel must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 2 (1d4) poison damage and must roll a d8 at the start of its next turn to determine what it does during that turn. On a 1 to 2, the creature sneezes uncontrollably and can move but can\u2019t take an action or a bonus action. On a 3-4, the creature's eyes water uncontrollably and it is considered blinded this turn. On a 5-8, the creature fights the additional effects of the pollen and can act normally."
