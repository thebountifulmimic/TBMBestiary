If a dogmole juggernaut draws blood against vermin, purple worms, or other underground invertebrate, it gains a +4 bonus to Strength and Constitution but suffers a -2 penalty to AC. The wormkiller rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1+ its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). It cannot end the rage voluntarily while the creatures that sent it into a rage still live."
