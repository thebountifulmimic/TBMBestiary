Hit points lost to magical weapons or radiant damage are not regained. When the creature reaches its full hit point total, less any magical weapon or radiant damage suffered, it rises, ready to fight again. A fallen cadaver can be prevented from reanimating by salting and burning the bones, casting gentle repose on it, or bathing the bones in cleansing sacred flame."
