Creatures can ascend the inner portions of the temple by using their climb speed and moving along the thick overgrowth and worn stone within.

This orb exudes bright green light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

Each creature touched by the beam must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 54 (12d8) radiant damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn.
