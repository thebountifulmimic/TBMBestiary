      "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the suturefly sews the target's mouth, nose, or eye closed. With supernatural speed, the suturefly repeatedly pierces the target's face, each time threading a loop of the target's own skin through the previous hole. These skin loops rapidly blacken, shrink, and draw the orifice tightly closed. It takes two actions and a sharp blade to sever the loops and reopen the orifice, and the process causes intense pain and 2 slashing damage. A victim whose mouth and nose have been sewn shut begins suffocating at the start of his or her next turn."
