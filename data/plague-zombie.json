      "desc": "A creature who takes a bite or claw attack, or who is within 15 feet of the plague zombie when it drops to 0 hit points, must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature contracts zombie rot. While it has zombie rot, the creature cannot regain hit points except via magical means, and it has vulnerability to slashing damage as its flesh rots. At the end of each long rest after being infected, the creature\u2019s maximum hit points are reduced by 3 (1d6) and it can repeat the saving throw, ending zombie rot on a success. Any reduction to the creature\u2019s hit point maximum is permanent until the zombie rot has been cured. The reduction ends after the creature\u2019s next long rest after being cured. If this reduction drops the creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies and rises as a plague zombie in 1d4 hours."
