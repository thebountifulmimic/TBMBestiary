If the target is a creature it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be diseased until the condition is cured. While the creature is diseased it is poisoned.. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target\u2019s hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured."
