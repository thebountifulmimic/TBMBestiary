      "desc": "The cerebug targets a stunned creature within 5 ft. and attempts to burrow into its skull cavity. The cerebug makes an attack with its burrowing claws, and any successful attack is a critical hit. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the cerebug burrows into the skull and eats the brain, killing the creature. It then occupies the skull cavity and takes control of the host body. The host body begins to rot within 24 hours, and the cerebug attempts to use the host body to lure new victims and consume more brains. If the cerebug leaves the host body, the dead creature can be restored to life with a resurrection spell or similar magic to restore the missing brain."
