A creature with a dipsa attached takes 3 (1d6) acid damage per round per dipsa, and it must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. If a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, the creature dies. This reduction to a creature's hit point maximum lasts until it is affected by a lesser restoration spell or comparable magic."
