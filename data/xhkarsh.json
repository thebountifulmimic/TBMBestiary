The target creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or a portion of the xhkarsh's consciousness inhabits its body. The target retains control of its body, but the xhkarsh can control its actions for 1 minute each day and can modify its memories as a bonus action (as if using the modify memory spell, DC 15). The target is unaware of the xhkarsh's presence, but can make a DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check once every 24 hours to notice the presence of the xhkarsh. This effect lasts until the xhkarsh ends it or the target's fate is restored by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic. A creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours when it succeeds on the saving throw to resist the effect or after the effect ends on it for any reason. A single xhkarsh can seize up to four strands at the same time."
