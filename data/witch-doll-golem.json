While cursed, the witch-doll golem deals an additional 13 (3d8) necrotic damage to the target when it hits with a weapon attack, and any damage the witch-doll golem takes from targets other than the cursed target is halved, and the cursed target takes the other half. The witch-doll golem can only have one active curse at a time. The target remains cursed until the golem is destroyed or the target dies; magic such as remove curse can end the curse early."
