On a failed saving throw, the creature makes all attacks rolls this turn with disadvantage as they are dazzled and confused by the vibrant display of the feymoth\u2019s wings. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can\u2019t see the feymoth until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the feymoth in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."
