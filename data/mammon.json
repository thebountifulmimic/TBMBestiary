It becomes an earth elemental made of precious metals and gems. The elemental acts immediately and lasts until destroyed or until Mammon uses this action again. - Stacked piles of treasure shift and slide, collapsing onto a creature Mammon can see. The creature is restrained until initiative count 20 on the following round, or until it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 18 Strength check to free it. - Mammon magically teleports from one area of treasure to another within 150 feet."

The resulting junk resumes its valuable form when Mammon claims it, or by means of a wish spell or comparable magic. - Creatures that spend more than 1 hour within 1 mile of Mammon's lair become obsessed with gaining the most generous payment or portion of wealth in any dealing unless they succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. A creature that saves successfully is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The effect can be removed by a greater restoration spell or comparable magic. - Any naturally occurring treasure in Mammon's home plane reverts to worthless junk if removed from the plane. Similarly, any mundane item left behind transforms into something fantastically valuable, as long as it remains on the plane. If Mammon dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days."
