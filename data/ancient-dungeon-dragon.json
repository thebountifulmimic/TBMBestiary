The dragon can use an action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of the dragon\u2019s next turn, the creature takes only the actions the dragon dictates and doesn\u2019t do anything that the dragon does not allow it to. In addition, the dragon can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires the dragon to use its reaction as well. The charmed creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it takes damage. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends."
