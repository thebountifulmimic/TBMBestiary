All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil.marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed by remove curse if the caster also makes a successful DC 23 spellcasting check. The mark reveals itself as desecrated to detect evil and good. It often shifts its position on the body, especially when it's concealed (and usually at the most inconvenient moment). Because such marks are sometimes placed on those who've made pacts with devils, NPC paladins and clerics might assume that any character bearing a devil's mark is in league with evil forces."
