Hit: 2 (1d4) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become the living host to a tsathar egg, which over the course of the egg maturing, migrates to the chest cavity of the host. The host creature must make another DC 13 Constitution saving throw after 24 hours of the egg having been implanted. A failed saving throw results in the host becoming violently ill, followed by a deep comalike state that lasts 2d6 + 2 days. At the end of each day, the host can attempt another saving throw with a success indicating that its body has managed to destroy the egg through normal immune response. At the end of the incubation period, the host awakes to excruciating pain as the young tsathar, freed from its egg, tears its way out of the host, who is reduced to 0 hit points in the process. A DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine) check can be attempted to surgically extract an egg from the host. A lesser restoration spell will also cure the condition and purge the host of the egg."
