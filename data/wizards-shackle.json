While it is attached, any time the target attempts to cast a cantrip or spell, it takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target fails to cast the spell and if a spell slot was used, it is wasted. The wizard\u2019s shackle can be removed as an action by the target or another creature. If a creature or creature to which the wizard\u2019s shackle is attached attempts to remove the wizard\u2019s shackle, the attached target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target is unconscious for 1 minute."
