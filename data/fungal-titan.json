      "name": "Scatter Spores (Recharge 5-6)",
      "desc": "The titan shakes its back and scatters a storm of spores across the battlefield, six of which will spawn into mushrooms. These locations must be within 60 feet of the titan and are unknown to the players until they sprout. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), these spores sprout into mushrooms. Roll a d4 to determine which type of mushroom spawns from each of these spores. These mushrooms are tiny plants with 10 hit points and AC 12. The fungal titan is immune to all effects from these mushrooms. * 1 \u2013 Noxious Mushroom \u2013 This light green mushroom constantly disperses deadly spores into the air. When a non-floral creature comes within 10 feet of the mushroom for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. * 2 \u2013 Blinding Mushroom \u2013 This white mushroom shines brightly, spinning back and forth and blasting the area with light. When a non-floral creature comes within 10 feet of the mushroom for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) radiant damage and become blinded until the end of the turn. * 3 \u2013 Entrancing Mushroom \u2013 This dark pink mushroom produces spores that are alluring to most living creatures. When a non-floral creature comes within 10 feet of the mushroom for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become captivated by this mushroom. That creature must use its action this turn to praise and worship the mushroom's beauty. * 4 \u2013 Explosive Mushroom \u2013 This mushroom glows bright orange and is incredibly volatile. The first time a non-floral creature moves while within 10 feet of the mushroom, it detonates in a blast of fire. Each creature within 10 feet on the mushroom make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one."
