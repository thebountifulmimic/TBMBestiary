Whenever the tactician makes a melee weapon attack, it can choose to execute one of these maneuvers to add additional effects to the attack. In addition to these other effects, all maneuvers cause the attacks to deal an additional 1d8 damage. Each tactician has two random maneuvers from the list below available for use: * Crippling Strike \u2013 The target's speed is 0 on its next turn. * Dizzying Strike \u2013 Concentration saving throws made as a result of this attack's damage are made at disadvantage. * Precise Strike \u2013 This attack is made with advantage. * Weakening Strike \u2013 The next weapon attack made by the target deals half damage (rounded down)."
