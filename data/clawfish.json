Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage, and if the target is a Small or larger creature, the clawfish can pull themself into the target\u2019s space and attach to the target. While attached, the clawfish moves with the target without provoking opportunity attacks, and the clawfish can\u2019t make Claw attacks. A creature who can reach the clawfish can use an action to make a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a success, the clawfish is detached and shunted into an unoccupied space of the clawfish\u2019s choice within 5 feet of the target. The clawfish also detaches if they become grappled, incapacitated, prone, or restrained, or if they use 5 feet of movement to detach."
