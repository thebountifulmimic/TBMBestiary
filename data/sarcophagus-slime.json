If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the sarcophagus slime's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours."

If the target can see the sarcophagus slime, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. If this effect reduces a creature's hit point maximum to 0, the creature dies and its corpse becomes a sarcophagus slime within 24 hours. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest or until it is affected by greater restoration or comparable magic."
