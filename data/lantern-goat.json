On a failure, the creature\u2019s soul is drawn into the lantern, where it will be digested over the next 1 hour by the lantern goat. Once the hour has elapsed, the creature dies and can only be returned to life by a resurrection, true resurrection, or wish spell. The lantern can only be removed from the lantern goat or be destroyed \u2014 thus releasing the trapped soul \u2014 if the lantern goat is slain."
