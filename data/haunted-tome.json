When any of those creatures are making a critical skill check (DM's discretion), that creature makes the roll with disadvantage as some random misfortune befalls them. These misfortunes automatically become documented within the pages of the tome along with humorous and degrading remarks regarding the outcome. When the tome is destroyed or someone else writes their name in the book, the curse is lifted."
