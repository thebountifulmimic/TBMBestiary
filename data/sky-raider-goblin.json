When a grenado explodes, all creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) piercing and 3 (1d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The grenado also ignites flammable materials in the area."

      "name": "Parachute",
      "desc": "The goblin can deploy the parachute as a reaction while falling, or as an action otherwise. The parachute requires at least a 10 foot cube of unoccupied space in which to deploy, and it doesn\u2019t open fast enough to slow a fall of less than 60 ft. If it has sufficient time and space to deploy properly, the parachute allows its wearer to land without taking falling damage. Once it has been used, the parachute takes 10 minutes to repack."
