The creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw after each long rest. On a failure, the creature gains one level of exhaustion and recovers no hit dice from the long rest. On a success, the creature recovers from one level of exhaustion and regains hit dice normally. If the infected creature reduces itself to zero exhaustion by making successful saving throws, the disease is cured."
