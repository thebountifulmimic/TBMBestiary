Creatures inside the ooze can be seen but have total cover. A creature within 5 feet of the ooze can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the ooze. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. If a skeleton is pulled out, it animates as if the skeletons ability was used."

On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the ooze. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, the ooze enters the creature\u2019s space, and the creature takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can\u2019t breathe, is restrained, and takes 27 (6d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of the ooze\u2019s turns. When the ooze moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ooze."

Slain skeletons are engulfed by the undead ooze and can be reanimated and expelled again in 1d2 hours. An undead ooze\u2019s form holds up to 10 skeletons of Medium size. These skeletons are included in the determination of the undead ooze\u2019s CR and experience points. They remain active even if the ooze is killed. Some undead oozes have unusual or larger skeletons inside of them."
