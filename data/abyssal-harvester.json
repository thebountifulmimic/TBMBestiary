      "desc": "An Abyssal harvester can remain on its Abyssal plane and inject up to four of its tentacles across the dimensions and into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, material planes, or Nine Hells. All of its tentacles must be injected into the same plane, and all appear within the same 20-foot square. While using this ability, it uses sensory organs on its tentacles to see, hear, smell, and feel its surroundings. It can attack normally while using this ability, but it cannot move from its current location. It can withdraw its tentacles as an action and reinject them into the same plane (or a different plane) on its next turn. The dismissal effect of a dispel evil or good spell causes an Abyssal harvester to withdraw a single tentacle if it fails its Charisma saving throw. It cannot reinject that same tentacle into the same plane for one day. A banishment spell forces an Abyssal harvester to withdraw all of its tentacles if it fails its Wisdom saving throw. It cannot reinject any tentacles that were banished into the same plane for one day."

An opponent drawn into the same plane with the harvester is still grappled upon arrival. This ability can only be used when the Abyssal harvester is on its Abyssal Plane and injects its tentacles into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, a material plane, or the Nine Hells."
