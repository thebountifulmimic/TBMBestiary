      "name": "Capsize",
      "desc": "If the sea serpent moves at least 30 feet straight toward a watercraft (boat, ship, ferry, etc.) and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, there is a chance that it will capsize. All occupants of the watercraft must make Dexterity saving throw when the craft is rammed (see below). To determine if the watercraft capsizes, consult the following table: * ***Small*** The craft is destroyed, all on board must make a successful DC 23 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being stunned. On a failed save, passengers each take 65 (10d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage, are trapped in the wreckage, and are stunned for 1 minute, or half as much on a successful save and are thrown clear of the wreckage. * ***Medium*** The craft must make a generic DC 20 saving throw to avoid being destroyed. If the craft fails the save by 5 or more, it capsizes and all on board must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being pulled under with the ship. If the save is successful, the ship takes 120 (20d10 + 10) damage and those on board must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the passenger takes 48 (7d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone (or overboard if they are near the ship\u2019s edge), or half as much without being knocked prone on a success. * ***Large*** The craft must make a generic DC 18 saving throw to avoid being capsized. If it fails the save by 5 or more, the ship capsizes and all on board must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being pulled under with the ship. If the save is successful, the ship takes 103 (17d10 + 10) damage and those on board must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the passenger takes 37 (5d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone (or overboard if they are near the ship\u2019s edge), or half as much without being knocked prone on a success. * ***Huge*** The craft must make a generic DC 16 saving throw to avoid being capsized. If it fails the save by 5 or more, the ship capsizes and all on board must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being pulled under with the ship. If the save is successful, the ship takes 81 (13d10 + 10) damage and those on board must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the passenger takes 26 (3d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone (or overboard if they are near the ship\u2019s edge), or half as much without being knocked prone on a success. * ***Gargantuan*** The craft must make a generic DC 14 saving throw to avoid being capsized. If it fails the save by 5 or more, the ship capsizes and all on board must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being pulled under with the ship. If the save is successful, the ship takes 65 (10d10 + 10) damage and those on board must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the passenger takes 15 (1d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone (or overboard if they are near the ship\u2019s edge), or half as much without being knocked prone on a success."
