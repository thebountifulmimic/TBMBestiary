It can only sing one chorus at a time. Any damage it takes forces it to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain the chorus. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken, whichever number is higher. * ***Chorus of Succor.*** While the Virtue sings, each ally may choose one condition they\u2019re suffering from at the start of their turn and end it. * ***Chorus of Inspiration.*** While the Virtue sings, each ally may add a d6 to the result of any attack roll or saving throw, once per round. The ally can wait until after they roll the d20 before deciding to use the inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. * ***Chorus of Retribution.*** While the Virtue sings, any enemy who deals damage to one of the Virtue\u2019s allies immediately takes 5 thunder damage. * ***Chorus of Damnation.*** While the Virtue sings, any extraplanar evil creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against spells that would send them to another plane."
