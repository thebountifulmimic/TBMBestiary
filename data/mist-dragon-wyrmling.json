      "desc": "The mist dragon uses one of the following breath weapons. 1. <i>Obscuring Mist.</i> The dragon exhales a murky opaque mist in a 15-foot cube that spreads around corners. This mist heavily obscures the area and remains for 1 minute, or until dispersed with a moderate or stronger wind (at least 10 miles per hour). 2. <i>Scalding Mist.</i> The dragon exhales a fiery blast of lingering mist in a 15- foot cone that spreads around corners. The mist lightly obscures the area and remains for 1 minute, or until dispersed with a moderate or stronger wind (at least 10 miles per hour). Each creature that enters the area or begins their turn there must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn\u2019t grant resistance to this damage."
