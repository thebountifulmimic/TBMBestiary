      "desc": "A steam golem that's immersed in water or whose boiler is soaked with at least 20 gallons of water (such as from a water elemental) may be stopped in its tracks by the loss of steam pressure in the boiler. In the case of a water elemental, dousing a steam golem destroys the elemental and the golem must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, the water instantly evaporates and the golem continues functioning normally. If it fails, the golem's fire is extinguished and the boiler loses pressure. The steam golem acts as if affected by a slow spell for 1d3 rounds, then becomes paralyzed until its fire is relit and it spends 15 minutes building up pressure."

If it fails, the spell is not cast; the spell slot is not used, but the caster's action is."
