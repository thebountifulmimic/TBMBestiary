      "desc": "If a red bulette is killed, its planar connection is immediately severed. Over the course of 4 to 6 hours, its body will cool to the ambient temperature of the environment. While the vast majority of its body will cool into a basalt-like stone, its digestive track will solidify into roughly 1,000 lbs. of an alloy admixture of every mineral substance it has consumed. Depending upon its recent feeding habits, this substance is the equivalent of metal-rich ore of many types in combination, and can be smelted back down into standard and precious metals by experts knowledgeable in such methods. Additionally, a few diamonds will be found in what was the red bulette\u2019s gizzard."

      "desc": "Red bulettes avoid overland movement, preferring to swim through earth and bedrock. If confronted above ground, they will reflexively increase their body temperatures enough to simply melt their way down into the ground and vanish. If threatened by a much larger creature, they simply dive underground and \u201cswim\u201d away. However, if they are threatened by any creature that wears or is carrying refined metals, they will instinctively return and attempt to ambush with a bite/swallow attack from underground."

While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the bulette, and it takes 21 (6d6) fire damage at the start of each of the bulette\u2019s turns. A bulette can have three Medium or smaller creatures swallowed at the same time."

      "name": "Death From Below (Recharge 5\u20136)",
      "desc": "If the bulette burrows at least 20 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to surface from underground in a space that contains one or more creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target\u2019s choice) or be knocked prone and splashed with globules of molten rock, taking 18 (2d12 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half damage, isn\u2019t knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette\u2019s space into an unoccupied space of the creature\u2019s choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature falls prone in the bulette\u2019s space."
